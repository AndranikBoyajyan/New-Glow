  "IPL phototherapy (Intense Pulsed Light) is a non-invasive treatment that uses broad-spectrum light to target pigmentation, redness, and other irregularities in the skin. Unlike lasers that use a single wavelength, IPL uses multiple wavelengths to treat various concerns at once, making it a versatile option for overall skin rejuvenation.";
