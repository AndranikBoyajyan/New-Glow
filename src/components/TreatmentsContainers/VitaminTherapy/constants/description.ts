  "IV (intravenous) vitamin therapy is a treatment that delivers a blend of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients directly into your bloodstream through an IV drip. This allows for faster absorption and higher bioavailability compared to oral supplements. IV vitamin therapy is used to boost energy, strengthen the immune system, support skin health, improve hydration, and aid recovery from stress, fatigue, illness, or intense physical activity. Itâ€™s also popular for enhancing overall wellness, especially when the body needs a quick and efficient nutrient boost.";
